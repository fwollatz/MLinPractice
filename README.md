# Machine Learning in Practice
Source code for the practical Seminar "Machine Learning in Practice", taught at OsnabrÃ¼ck University in the winter term 2021/2022 at the Insitute of Cognitive Science.

As data source, we use the "Data Science Tweets 2010-2021" data set (version 3) by Ruchi Bhatia from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/data-science-tweets). The goal of our example project is to predict which tweets will go viral, i.e., receive many likes and retweets.

## Virtual Environment

In order to install all necessary dependencies, please make sure that you have a local [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution (e.g., Anaconda or miniconda) installed. Begin by creating a new environment called "MLinPractice" that has Python 3.6 installed:

```conda create -y -q --name MLinPractice python=3.6```

You can enter this environment with `conda activate MLinPractice` (or `source activate MLinPractice`, if the former does not work). You can leave it with `conda deactivate` (or `source deactivate`, if the former does not work). Enter the environment and execute the following commands in order to install the necessary dependencies (this may take a while):

```
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge scikit-learn=0.24.2
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge matplotlib=3.3.4
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge nltk=3.6.3
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge gensim=4.1.2
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge spyder=5.1.5
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge pandas=1.1.5
conda install -y -q -c conda-forge mlflow=1.20.2
conda install -c conda-forge tweepy
```

You can double-check that all of these packages have been installed by running `conda list` inside of your virtual environment. The Spyder IDE can be started by typing `~/miniconda/envs/MLinPractice/bin/spyder` in your terminal window (assuming you use miniconda, which is installed right in your home directory).

In order to save some space on your local machine, you can run `conda clean -y -q --all` afterwards to remove any temporary files.

The installed libraries are used for machine learning (`scikit-learn`), visualizations (`matplotlib`), NLP (`nltk`), word embeddings (`gensim`), and IDE (`spyder`), and data handling (`pandas`)

## Overall Pipeline

The overall pipeline can be executed with the script `code/pipeline.sh`, which executes all of the following shell scripts:
- The script `code/load_data.sh` downloads the raw csv files containing the tweets and their metadata. They are stored in the folder `data/raw/` (which will be created if it does not yet exist).
- The script `code/preprocessing.sh` executes all necessary preprocessing steps, including a creation of labels and splitting the data set.
- The script `code/feature_extraction.sh` takes care of feature extraction.
- The script `code/dimensionality_reduction.sh` takes care of dimensionality reduction.
- The script `code/classification.sh` takes care of training and evaluating a classifier.
- The script `code/application.sh` launches the application example.

In addition an test script was introduced, for automating test execution:
- The script `test/run_tests.sh` collects and run all unit tests under the `/test` folder

## Preprocessing

All python scripts and classes for the preprocessing of the input data can be found in `code/preprocessing/`.

### Creating Labels

The script `create_labels.py` assigns labels to the raw data points based on a threshold on a linear combination of the number of likes and retweets. It is executed as follows:
```python -m code.preprocessing.create_labels path/to/input_dir path/to/output.csv```
Here, `input_dir` is the directory containing the original raw csv files, while `output.csv` is the single csv file where the output will be written.
The script takes the following optional parameters:
- `-l` or `--likes_weight` determines the relative weight of the number of likes a tweet has received. Defaults to 1.
- `-r` or `--retweet_weight` determines the relative weight of the number of retweets a tweet has received. Defaults to 1.
- `-t` or `--threshold` determines the threshold a data point needs to surpass in order to count as a "viral" tweet. Defaults to 50.

### Classical Preprocessing

The script `run_preprocessing.py` is used to run various preprocessing steps on the raw data, producing additional columns in the csv file. It is executed as follows:
```python -m code.preprocessing.run_preprocessing path/to/input.csv path/to/output.csv```
Here, `input.csv` is a csv file (ideally the output of `create_labels.py`), while `output.csv` is the csv file where the output will be written.
The preprocessing steps to take can be configured with the following flags:
- `-p` or `--punctuation`: A new column with suffix "_tokenized" is created, where all punctuation is removed from the original tweet. (See `code/preprocessing/punctuation_remover.py` for more details)
- `-t` or `--tokenize`: Tokenize the given column (can be specified by `--tokenize_input`, default = "tweet"), and create new column with suffix "_tokenized" containing tokenized tweet.
- `-l` or `--filter_english`: Filters out tweets marked as english 'en' before applying general preprocessing steps. This is option is by default activated.
- `-s` or `--stem`: Applies stemming on the tweets. Requires the tweet to be tokenized. This option is by default active.  (See `code/preprocessing/stemmer.py` for more details)
- `-lc`or `--lower_case`: Lower cases all words within a tweet. This option is by default active. (See `code/preprocessing/lower_caser.py` for more details)
- `-swr` or `--stop_word_removal`: Removes stop words from all tweets. Requires the tweet to be stemmed. This option by default activated. (See `code/preprocessing/stop_word_remover.py` for more details)
- `-feu` or `--filter_emojis_urls`: Removes all emojis and urls from the tweets. Requires the tweet be punctuation freed. This option by default activated. (See `code/preprocessing/emoji_url_remover.py` for more details)
- `-ee` or `--extract_emojis`: Extract all emojis from the tweet. 
- For the column names produced during the different steps, please refer to the `code.util.py` where all names are stored.


The overall default order of preprocessing the tweets is: 

`--filter_english` > `--lower_case` > `--punctuation` > `--filter_emojis_urls` > `--tokenize` > `--stem` > `--stop_word_removal`

Moreover, the script accepts the following optional parameters:
- `-e` or `--export` gives the path to a pickle file where an sklearn pipeline of the different preprocessing steps will be stored for later usage.

Further, in under `test/preprocessing/` all unit tests for the preprocessor can be found. 

### Splitting the Data Set

The script `split_data.py` splits the overall preprocessed data into training, validation, and test set. It can be invoked as follows:
```python -m code.preprocessing.split_data path/to/input.csv path/to/output_dir```
Here, `input.csv` is the input csv file to split (containing a column "label" with the label information, i.e., `create_labels.py` needs to be run beforehand) and `output_dir` is the directory where three individual csv files `training.csv`, `validation.csv`, and `test.csv` will be stored.
The script takes the following optional parameters:
- `-t` or `--test_size` determines the relative size of the test set and defaults to 0.2 (i.e., 20 % of the data).
- `-v` or `--validation_size` determines the relative size of the validation set and defaults to 0.2 (i.e., 20 % of the data).
- `-s` or `--seed` determines the seed for initializing the random number generator used for creating the randomized split. Using the same seed across multiple runs ensures that the same split is generated. If no seed is set, the current system time will be used.


## Feature Extraction

All python scripts and classes for feature extraction can be found in `code/feature_extraction/`.

The script `extract_features.py` takes care of the overall feature extraction process and can be invoked as follows:
```python -m code.feature_extraction.extract_features path/to/input.csv path/to/output.pickle```
Here, `input.csv` is the respective training, validation, or test set file created by `split_data.py`. The file `output.pickle` will be used to store the results of the feature extraction process, namely a dictionary with the following entries:
- `"features"`: a numpy array with the raw feature values (rows are training examples, columns are features)
- `"feature_names"`: a list of feature names for the columns of the numpy array
- `"labels"`: a numpy array containing the target labels for the feature vectors (rows are training examples, only column is the label)

The script `reduce_dimensionality.py` takes care of the overall dimensionality reduction procedure and can be invoked as follows:

```python -m code.dimensionality_reduction.reduce_dimensionality path/to/input.pickle path/to/output.pickle```
Here, `input.pickle` is the respective training, validation, or test set file created by `extract_features.py`.

## Application

All python code for the application demo can be found in `code/application/`.

The script `application.py` provides a simple command line interface, where the user is asked to type in their prospective tweet, which is then analyzed using the trained ML pipeline.
The script can be invoked as follows:
```python -m code.application.application path/to/preprocessing.pickle path/to/feature_extraction.pickle path/to/dimensionality_reduction.pickle path/to/classifier.pickle```
The four pickle files correspond to the exported versions for the different pipeline steps as created by `run_preprocessing.py`, `extract_features.py`, `reduce_dimensionality.py`, and `run_classifier.py`, respectively, with the `-e` option.
